# Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) / Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)

Tags: #EcologicalEconomics 

Multi Criteria Analysis can be used to facilitate the design and implementation of sustainable bioenergy projects ([[Buchholz et al., 2009. Multi Criteria Analysis for bioenergy systems assessments]]. It is mainly [[Deliberative Paradigm]] but an instrumental paradigm can be incorporated in it.

Tools based on MCA have shown potential to guide stakeholders to find and agree on sustainable solutions in a wide range of fields. They are very effective in combining quantitative and qualitative data.

MCA: Formal approaches which seek to take explicit account of multiple criteria in helping individuals and groups explore decisions that matter. 
It uses 'unifying units' to offset poor performances of one criterion by good performances of another criterion, therefore allowing for substitution and compensability between criteria.

MCA methods can be classified as:
1. [[Multi Objective Decision Making (MODM)]]: approaches working with an indefinite set of possible scenarios;
2. [[Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM)]]: suggesting a finite set of scenarios.

Using MCA proved
	1. to be valuable in structuring the problem that needed to be addressed and
	2. involving many stakeholders from different disciplines and perspectives 
	in difficult decision-making situations where facts were uncertain, values were disputed, stakes were high, and decisions needed to be made quickly.

Steps in application include:
	1. Stakeholder identification
	2. Participatory modeling of competing scenarios in a workshop setting
	3. Criteria selection and weighting
	4. Ranking of scenarios

Some kinds of uncertainty present in the process in relation to the data analysis both in the input and output phases:
	1. Uncertainty of preferences (inconsistent or unclear choices of an individual decision-maker or disagreements between several stakeholders)
	2. Uncertainty due to randomness
	3. Uncertainty caused by imprecision.

Main leverage points (small shifts can lead to large changes in ranking of scenarios) in an MCA are:
	1. weighting criteria
	2. assessing scenario performances.

The robustness of the MCA can be checked by a [[Sensitivity Analysis]] which identifies the leverage points.

[[Ecosystem Service Concept]] can be incorporated into MCDA as a criteria ([[Fortuna et al., 2013. Comparing land-use alternatives]]).

MCDAs are seen to be more likely to achieve realizable results because of its transparency and traceability when there exist a discrete and finite number of alternatives.

Some difficulties observed in doing MCDAs:
	1. Individuals may have problems in distinguishing personal POVs from the POVs of the organization or field they are representing
	2. Difficulties in comparing two ecosystems if the services are very similar
	3. Varying degrees of familiarity with certain services or the awareness of certain services in society affect people's rankings.
	4. Low availability of data regarding specifics of ecosystems etc for use as indicators
	5. Difficulties in finding appropriate easy to measure indicators especially for factors such as cultural services
	6. Provisioning services are difficult to assess with [[Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)]].

Three things to keep in mind:
	1. Identifying all criteria that stakeholders may think as important (a deliberative process) and then grouping criteria to make decision making process simpler
	2. Deciding how these different criteria contribute to the decision (weighting the criteria)
		1. It is ideal to come to a consensus instead of taking averages or voting on it
	3. Ranking each alternative based on the criteria (also deliberative; if that fails, we try an instrumental method) and then aggregate based on weights
		1. One way is to use a Likeard scale
