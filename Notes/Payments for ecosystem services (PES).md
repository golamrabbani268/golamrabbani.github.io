# Payments for ecosystem services (PES)

Engel (2016:133) defines PES as positive economic incentives where environmental service (ES) providers can voluntarily apply for a payment that is conditional either on ES provision or on an activity clearly linked to ES provision.

Uses a "steward-rewarded" approach (Engel et al., 2008) that makes these policies well-suited to promote the conservation of land under indigenous control.

However, the literature examining PES in the context of indigenous communities shows mixxed results ([[Lliso et al., 2020. Applying deliberative valuation in an indigineous community in Colombia]]).
