# The Deliberative Paradigm

Tags: #EcologicalEconomics 

## Questions to think about:

1. In what ways are the deliberative and [[Instrumental Paradigm]]s similar? What does the deliberative paradigm add to the instrumental paradigm? What does it lack as compared to the instrumental?
2. When do you think it is good to employ a deliberative approach? In what circumstances is it not good to employ?
3. What paradigms do you align the most? Why?
	1. More inclined towards instrumental paradigm due to results being more tangible in informing decisions and helps reduce complexity. But this may actually be a drawback in complex circumstances.
