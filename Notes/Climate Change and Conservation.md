# Climate Change and Conservation

## Possible Challenges

1. Regime shifts
2. Habitat loss
3. Fragmentation
4. Changing population demographics, migration, breeding
5. (Mc Carty, 2001)

### Tenodera aridifolia (Mantis)

Effect of hard frost. Causes tissues to die. 

Sugar plums. 

Mantis die when its very cold

### Mammalian diversity

Shift in diversity from now to 2050 in Brazil. 

[[Refugia]] are places where a high diversity of species will exist in the future. Low risk areas.

Focussing on high risk vs refugia. Refugia have low risk but only protecting them may not protect all local diversity.

### Fires
[[Forests and FIres]]

### Moose and Caribou

Moose population increases increases wolf populations which in part reduce caribou populations. Experiment showed reducing moose populations stabilized caribou populations.

[[Conservation Planning and Priorities]] Such indirect effects and how they are influenced by climate change affect conservation strategies.

### Saiga Antelope

Death from septicemia from innocuous bacteria emphasized from temperature anomaly and humidity.

### Corals

High temperatures leave particular corals more prone to certain diseases and so are more prone to bleaching.

### Bark Beetles

Bark beetle ranges are restricted by cold winters.

Fungus-carrying bark beetles have spread because of climate change (milder winters).

Bark beetles kill trees and so climate change results in large areas of dead trees. This in turn can lead to more forest fires. [[Forests and FIres]]
