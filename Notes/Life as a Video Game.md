# Life as a Video Game

## Objectives

Clear objectives and how to do it through sub-objectives. Vagueness results in no action or progress being made.

## Difficulty

Life is more difficult/complicated than video game. Time, sacrifices, emotions, physical.

## Risk

Everything in life has a risk. But video games don't really have a risk.

## Rewards

Rewards in life are more rewarding and long term.

# What to do:
- Get clearer objectives. Define goals, steps to get them, and rewards from that.
- Reduce the difficulty. Break down quests into smaller (daily) segments. Start small (easy) and upgrade with time.
- Overcome resistance and absorb the power. Seeing pockets of discomfort as power-ups. Becoming better at overcoming discomfort.
- Embrace risks. Becoming more comfortable with risks makes you more bearable to short term discomforts.
- Regularly reflect on the rewards life has to offer.
