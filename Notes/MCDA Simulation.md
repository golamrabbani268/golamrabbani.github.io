# Criteria Setting (Reach consensus by 1.45pm)

Introduce self, organization, and what criteria you would like to see taken into account and why (2-3 minutes each)

### Define
Define each criteria explicitly and in detail.

### Debate
Debate on why the criteria should/should not be considered and the explicit definition.

### Refine
Refine the definitions into exact meanings and group similar criteria to reach less than seven (7).

### Consensus
Everyone should be alright with the criteria chosen with no serious disagreements.

# Criteria Weighing (Reach consensus by 2.20pm; extension to 3.30pm; instrumental after)

Present all criteria (Prof might have slides for this)
Debate, Refine, Consensus
Try to include everyone in this section.

# Alternatives Ranking

If there is enough time, try deliberative. (Debate, refine, consensus).
If not, let participants write their rankings on paper/online (Use prof's excel sheet). Then present results:
		1. Summary results
		2. Personal results (anonymously or named)
Re-rank alternatives after a short discussion if time allows.

# Closing

Show final round of voting and chosen alternative.
