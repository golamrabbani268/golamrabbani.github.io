# MCDA Simulation

Tags: #EcologicalEconomics 
Concept: [[Multi Criteria (Decision) Analysis (MC(D)A)]]

# Introduction

Placards (Name + Org)
Introduce self
Set rules:
		1. Raise hands to speak and you'll be called upon
		2. Be polite and respectful
		3. Try not to dominate the conversation and give others the opportunity to contribute
		4. In situations where we are out of time and have not reached consensus, the moderator may decide to use an instrumental method such as voting or taking means.
		5. Please share if you have any other rules you want for the session and inform me if I'm doing something wrong etc.
Introduce topic:
	Developing the southern islands
	Current alternatives are:
			1: Status Quo
			2: Nickelodeon Lost Island
			3: More
Flow:
		Criteria setting
		Criteria weighting
		Alternatives ranking

# Criteria Setting (Reach consensus by 1.45pm)

Introduce self, organization, and what criteria you would like to see taken into account and why (2-3 minutes each)

### Define
Define each criteria explicitly and in detail.

### Debate
Debate on why the criteria should/should not be considered and the explicit definition.

### Refine
Refine the definitions into exact meanings and group similar criteria to reach less than seven (7).

### Consensus
Everyone should be alright with the criteria chosen with no serious disagreements.

# Criteria Weighing (Reach consensus by 2.20pm; extension to 3.30pm; instrumental after)

Present all criteria (Prof might have slides for this)
Debate, Refine, Consensus
Try to include everyone in this section.

# Alternatives Ranking

If there is enough time, try deliberative. (Debate, refine, consensus).
If not, let participants write their rankings on paper/online (Use prof's excel sheet). Then present results:
		1. Summary results
		2. Personal results (anonymously or named)
Re-rank alternatives after a short discussion if time allows.

# Closing

Show final round of voting and chosen alternative.


# Reflection

1) After going through the simulation, what are some of the benefits and advantages of doing MCDA? What do these mean for ecological economics and decision-making impacting social and ecological systems in general?

2) What are some of the challenges of doing MCDA? What do these challenges mean in ecological economics? Are these challenges surmountable, especially from the perspective of ecological economics?

3) How would you compare MCDA and BCA? Which one would you recommend? Why?

   

Source of bias in weighting with initial weights

Hard to weigh many things with overlaps

True deliberation may never happen due to people getting frustrated and giving up on their aims

Time

Nudging by moderators

## Based on your experience of conducting MCDA, is it a better approach than monetary valuation and Cost Benefit analysis?

Role of mediator, power dynamics, 

Role of mediator:
	- Actively vs passively asking for opinions
	- Level of calling out particular stakeholders
	- Shaping groups from mediator's observations
	- Pushing or suggesting compromises or solutions

Power [[Power]]:
- Power dynamics through sitting in groups (according to interest) to form arguements through discussions and have a more collaborative approach to making arguements while other groups may be more dispersed only having a telegram chat.
- Groupings according to position.
- Both above affect quality and collaborativeness of arguments
- Stakeholders with more ambivalent or niche ideas were disfavoured or not effective.
- Some groups /individuals were more confrontational in arguements (may be due to power from group they are representing o from their own personal quality)
- Others favouring a more calmer approach
- Some stakeholder groups had more clearer or more understood goals while others had less generally accepted catchphrases and vocabulary to use.
- 

MCDA method generally:
- Way of weighting criteria with initial values affects the methodology: starting from averages versus from a quick vote and averaging
- Very atomistic view of criteria. Many non-comparable or inter-connected ideas have to be separated. This also affects arguements for weighting various criteria by saying that more broad criterias should be given more priority etc.
- Some ideas or criteria were understood differently by different people and so need to find a commonly understood measure.
- Ranking phase without deliberation allows more dominant groups to win through averages.
- Not deliberating on the alternatives itself may mean choosing between alternatives and not having a chance to deliberate on the details of the alternatives.
- Some criterias were very broad and so having less or more than expected weights.
- People on the ground may not be included and so their interests may not be represented. Also choice of stakeholders to invite affects dynamics.
- Time limitations limit effectiveness of deliberation and ability to reach consensus.
- Personal and organizational POVs may conflict or differ. 
- An individual may not be able to take decisions for a whole organisation itself. Each organisation have their own decision structure which would need to be consulted by individuals representing that org.
- Making promises without a guarantee (ex: money later for env etc.)
	- Individual orgs may not keep promises
	- whole MCDA decision may not be given sigificance by decision-makers in final decision process.
- Minority voices may get ignored or left behind after frustrations or disagreements with the dominant groups.

### Is an MCDA worth it compared to BCAs?

[[Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)]]

MCDA giving more opportunities and power to various stakeholders.
BCA is faster and less resource intensive compared to MCDA
	Meta-CBA needed
	Some MCDA features can be obtained through interviews alongside a BCA and so save more resources
MCDA may also have barriers through language, knowledge, vocabulary etc.
	Role of political translators and changes of arguements through translation
Mediate the mediator
	through representives of each stakeholder
In MCDA, individuals may have to quickly form arguements from facts etc. Can have someone to take notes for everyne during the session to avoid repeating things.
Combining MCDA and CBA
	Addressing biases, ignorances etc.
Open vs Close door MCDAs.
Taking MCDA decisions seriously into final decision-making process.
**To what extent can Ecological Economics influence decisions?**
**Navigating through power dynamics?**
