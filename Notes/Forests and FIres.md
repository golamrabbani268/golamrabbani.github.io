# Forests & Fire

### Smokey Bear

Campaign by logging companies to reduce forest fires to protect trees.

**Was this helpful or harmful?**

The longer the time since the last fire, the higher the severity of the fire.

## Fire and Ecology

Some trees seed with fire:
- Giant sequoias and pinecones which only open at high heat.

Some ecosystems depend on fire:
- shortgrass and tallgrass prairies are largely maintained by fires
	- Waterways introduce some complexity to these habitats by having trees near them.

Controlled fires are done to maintain such systems. This was also done by indigenous North Americans.

**But fire isnt always good**

Burning arctic tundra releases sequestered carbon. A positive feedback loop.
