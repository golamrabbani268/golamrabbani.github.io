# Conservation Planning and Priorities

Tags: #ConservationEcology

Various templates for conservation priorities have been developed and they incorporate various measures of vulnerability and irreplaceability.

## Measures of Vulnerability

Four types (Wilson et al., 2005):
1. Environmental and spatial variables
2. Land tenure
3. Threatened species
4. Expert opinion

## Measures of Irreplaceability

Most common measure is plant endemism, bird endemism etc. Others include taxonomic uniqueness, unusual phenomena, global rarity of habitat types.

## Spatial Units

Most conservation priority templates use countries, restricted-range of bird species, and "ecoregions".

## Benefits

Measures of benefits from such templates include publication impact, impacts on resource allocation.

## Questions to still answer

The relationship/congruence between the priorities set for protection of one species/taxa and the priorities for protecting other species or taxa.

The extent to which conservation priorities represent not just current diversity but also evolutionary history.

Global conservation prioritization concern intersection with human values.
