# Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM)

Tags: #EcologicalEconomics 

MADM approaches start with a set of scenarios, which are then further scrutinized in how well they fit a set of principles.

MADM approaches can be differentiated into:
1. [[Value Measurement Models]]: Models assign a numerical score to each scenario, thus ranking scenarios depending on how they score according to a **weighted** list of criteria.
2. [[Goal, Aspiration, and Reference-level Models]]: Goal programming methods where a mathematical programming algorithm is used to approach these goals as closely as possible.
3. [[Outranking Models]]: The scenarios are compared pair-wise to check which of them is preferred regarding each criterion. After aggregation of the results of the results for each criterion, this approach suggests to what extent the scenarios outrank each other.
