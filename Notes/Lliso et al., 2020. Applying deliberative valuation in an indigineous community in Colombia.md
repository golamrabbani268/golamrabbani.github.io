Not all experiences with PES in indigenous communities have been positive. Many communities have opposed such projects. A large contributing factor is the feeling of their voices not beeing listened to throughout the design process of PES schemes resulting in negative impacts and negotiations between indigenous communities and PES managers have sometimes been characterized by [[Power]] asymmetries that have perpetuated and entrenched pre-existent inequalities.

## Objectives of paper

1. Exploring under what conditions indigenous communities are more likely to accept participating in PES programs in order to guarantee their acceptance and success;
2. Shedding light on whether deliberative valuation approaches are suited to elicit the preferences of indigenous people.
